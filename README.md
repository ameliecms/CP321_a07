All charts and visualizations created should be easily comprehensible and must 
incorporate all necessary components, such as labels, legends, colour coding, and 
a title. 

Construct a concise dashboard to display the FIFA Soccer World Cup winners and 
runner-ups (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_finals). The 
dashboard should utilize Choropleth map to visualize the data. 

Step 1: Create a dataset for your dashboard. [5] 

Step 2: Enable user interaction with the dashboard, allowing users to: 
a. View all countries that have ever won a World Cup. [5] 
b. Select a country and view the number of times it has won the World Cup. [5] 
c. Select a year when a World Cup was organized and view the winner and the 
runner-up. [5] 

Step 3: Publish your code on a server. Include a link to your published dashboard 
as a comment at the top of your code. Additionally, include the password if you 
have password-protected your website. [5]
